                <h2>VOCAL FOR LOCAL
                </h2>
                <p>The basic meaning of Vocal for Local is to make local and use local also promote local products. This initiative will provide employment to the many people of that region and the local market will develop. After some time these local markets will progress so high that they will export their famous products in many countries across the world. If we use local products this will not only strengthen local identity but also boost economy of that area and country.
                Vocal for Local also encourage people to start producing all the necessary products locally and reduce the use of imported products. During the countrywide lock-down when all the mediums of transport were on halt, entire world realize the value of vocal for local and usefulness of local products. We should learn the lessen from this also and promote local products.

                <h2>INDIA @75YEARS
                </h2>
                <p>The sacrifices of our brave Indian freedom fighters are remembered on Independence Day. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, unfurled the tricolour national flag at Red Fort and Lahori Gate in Delhi when the country became Independent. From that day, India celebrates Independence Day on this day. Many programmes dedicated at Red fort, such as 21 gunshots fired for the start of events, march past by our Indian soldiers, and cultural activities by school kids are held in honour of the soldiers who fought for the nation's independence. Kite flying is also a part of the Independence Day of India's celebration, with kites of various sizes, shapes, and colours filling the sky. From 1974 onwards, the chief ministers of several states unfurled the national flag.</p>

                <h2>ATMANIRBHAR BHARAT
                </h2>
                <p>The year 2020 has been a disastrous one not just for India but for every country in the world due to the rapid spread of coronavirus. which eventually led to a pandemic. 

                    The disease impacted the country's economy on a large scale, thus further damaging growth and progress. 
                    
                    In these times, when the economy seemed to fall with each passing day, Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi introduced a concept called Atma Nirbhar Bharat.
                    
                    On 12th May 2020, prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a package of 20 Lakhs crore to revive the economy and address the issues affecting various sections of people. 
                    
                    The package is about 10% India total GDP. Atma nirbhar Bharat is the mission and vision of our P.M. Narendra Modi to make India Self- reliant. The real meaning of Atma Nirbhar is Self-Reliant India. 
                    
                    Atmanirbhar means to promote and give preference to indigenous products match their imported counter parts in cost and quality. 
                    
                    Self-reliant doesn't mean that we are court off from the Global world, but it actually means that we are able to produce the products and eventually play a larger role in the global economy.</p>
